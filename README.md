A giant art installation; knock over a symbol of hate

Setup a new art installment.

It is a giant modified kind of swastika attached to a railing.

There is a sign that reads:
Knock over this symbol of hate. This is a American Democrat Nazi Socialist symbol of hate.

The people sit and chill in the interior plaza. Shouting at the kids who are always pushing over the symbol. “ I don’t want to see that thing stop rolling!”, they shout.

It rolls around a circle. The wheel of life rolls around but is being knocked over at the same time.

For one thousand years let this stand.

But when ready, remove the sign that reads about evil. And, replace it with a sign that reads. 

This is a representation of the wheel of life.

Blame it on Banksy!

Honestly, why don’t we do art and blame it on Banksy, just as a meme?
